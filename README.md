### Install dependencies

In your terminal after downloading code from this repo, run `npm install` to build all the dependencies in the project for both client and server.

We have to start the server first and then run the frontend application later on.<br/>
To start the server, from your terminal, run `cd server` and then `node server.js` to start server.<br/>
